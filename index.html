        <h2>It's me, Mario</h2>
        <p>Mario is a beloved video game character created by Nintendo, first introduced in the 1981 arcade game *Donkey Kong*. Since then, he has become the face of one of the most successful franchises in video game history. Mario is typically portrayed as a brave Italian plumber who lives in the Mushroom Kingdom and sets off on adventures to rescue Princess Peach from the villain Bowser. The core gameplay of most Mario games involves running, jumping, and defeating enemies while navigating colorful, imaginative worlds filled with coins, power-ups, and secret areas.

          Over the years, Mario has starred in a wide variety of games beyond traditional platformers, including racing (*Mario Kart*), sports (*Mario Tennis*, *Mario Golf*), and party games (*Mario Party*). These titles have helped make Mario a household name across generations of gamers. With simple controls, iconic music, and charming visuals, Mario games are known for being fun and accessible for players of all ages, while still offering depth and challenge for those seeking it. Marioâ€™s legacy continues to grow with new games, merchandise, and even a major motion picture, keeping the character relevant for both old fans and newcomers.</p>
